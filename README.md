# Simple Website Template

Based off of another website, this one is even more slimmed down. It contains the *essentials* and nothing else. I am using this for instructional use but also perfect for actual use.

## Live demo

You can see the live site [here](https://westley-workshop-demo.netlify.app/).

## Usage

Download this repo manually or by using `git clone https://github.com/Westley-Winks/simple-website-template.git <folder_name>`. Use a local live server (I recommend the VSCode extension [Live Server](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/)) to see the site.

To make content changes, open `index.html` and write whatever HTML you want. Styling is already set based on the tags and classes aren't necessary to make it look good. If you do want to change the styling, open `main.css` and write your own CSS. To change the main icon, replace `favicon.ico` with your own `.ico` logo.

To deploy, I recommend [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify's drag and drop is the easiest way to get started.
